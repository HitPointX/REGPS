At the second zombie, run through hugging the right wall hoping for good RNG, or pause briefly at the camera transition to orient and attempt to avoid.\n    - Safe: Same as above, but definitely pause for the second zombie.\n    - Note: If you spend too long in this room, a zombie will break in from the eastern stairwell doorway, significantly complicating later traversal through this hallway.",

Getting wrist bit or knocked to the ground more than once is usually a reset.\n    - Safe: Shoot as much as you can and hope for the dog to knock you to the ground which will activate the defense dagger and should finish it off.

Bait the second zombie.\n    - Safe: Run through the first doorway in front of the crimson head instead. The crimson will always lunge at you and fail, giving ample to time to exit early and avoid the remaining two zombies. You can then run through the back of the zombie in the stairwell room, and if you're fast enough you can simply run past the zombie that breaks through the door from the dog balcony, exiting back into the upper dining hall. This loses ~10 seconds (and will mess up your auto splits if using door splits), but is much safer than attempting murder hall while still learning how to bait.",

You're about to get some herbs in a couple of rooms anyway.",
        "Proceed around the downstairs hallway to the furthest door, avoiding the zombie.\n    - Fast: If you can see the zombie's hands on the left of the screen before the camera transition this usually means you're safe to simply keep running past him along the outer wall. Otherwise attempt to bait him after the transition if necessary.\n    - Safe: Stop at the camera transition to see the zombie's position and move around him. Sometimes he'll be right on the transition though and you can't avoid ]him.",

Proceed to pickup __Death Mask 1__ afterward and exit the room.\n    - Fast: Angling slightly toward the mask and mashing A will allow the mask to be grabbed from a distance while moving.\n    - Safe: Grab as many green herbs as you'd like and combine them.",

Skip the cutscene and proceed through the next door.\n    - Note: If you took too long returning to Richard on a casual run he will be dead. This doesn't hurt anything with regards to the run, but it may make your upcoming Yawn 1 fight more difficult.",
        "Turn down the hallway and enter the door past the zombie.\n    - Safe: Even of this zombie won't lunge, as long as he's hugging the left wall you can usually move around his right side safely.",
        "Proceed around the room and light the candle then immediately begin pushing the shelf. Avoid the zombie behind it if possible, grab the __Musical Score 1__, and leave the room.\n    - Fast: After finishing the shelf push, hold up and left on the dpad to slowly turn into the room behind it then backpedal as the zombie lunges to bait him. Wait for him to finish recovering if necessary before running back around him after grabbing the score. It is then optimal to leave the room around the off-camera side of the table, but if the zombie that has entered the room cannot be seen it's usually not worth the risk.\n    - Safe: There is stun gun in the shelf to the left of the candle which can be retrieved once the room is lit. The zombie behind the shelf is difficult to deal with optimally, so it's safer to have a defense item ready.",
        "Proceed back through Richard's hallway (the inner turns with the herbs are faster), down the main hall, through the dining room, and down the hallway past the zombie to the piano room.\n    - Fast: Bait the zombie if it's not sleeping. Otherwise try to squeeze to the right and pray.\n    - Safe: If the zombie is far enough to the left, it's possible to squeeze around him, but otherwise baiting or tanking is your only option.",
        "Move around to the shelf and push it to retrieve the __Musical Score 2__. Go to the piano, combine the two scores and use them to open the wall to the __Gold Emblem__.\n    - Fast: The shelf only needs about a half push to grab the score. The combined score can be used from the side of the piano. The second score should be in the 7th inventory slot with the first to its upper right in the 6th slot.",
        "After grabbing the Emblem, mash the menu button and immediately mash confirm to use the old Emblem, which should now be in the first inventory slot. Leave the room and return to the dining hall.\n    - Note: The zombie in the hallway can be easily avoiding this time by running through his back on the right side.",
        "Place the gold Emblem above the fireplace then proceed to the clock puzzle. The button inputs are:\n    1. Confirm, \u27a1\ufe0fConfirm, Confirm\n    2. Confirm, \u27a1\ufe0fConfirm, Confirm\n    3. Cancel, Confirm",

        "Move toward the center of the room to activate the cutscene, then hold down-right on the control stick while mashing to skip the second cutscene, which should immediately start you toward __Death Mask 2__ in the back of the room. Grab the mask, turn and exit along the outside of the room to avoid Yawn.\n    - Safe: After grabbing the mask and moving toward the right of the nearest vertical support beam, pause and wait for Yawn if it has not moved past the left side of the beam before continuing. This guarantees that Yawn will not do the sideways head slam on you (which always poisons) while passing on the right.\n    - Note: Yawn poison can only be cured by getting more serum from the Eastern Stairwell save room. This is of course always a reset for high level runs.",
        "Return to the main eastern hallway through Richard hallway which will now have a zombie in it that is easily avoided when moving through the inner turns of this room.",
        "Proceed toward the inner double metal doors of the hallway past the zombie and into the room with the suits of armor.\n    - Note: You can pause on the camera transition with the zombie and attempt to move past the widest side of him, otherwise the only option is to bait.",
        "Push the armored statues in the order of: upper right, lower left, lower right. The upper left statue will move into place automatically and the button can then be pressed to open the gate to the jewelry box containing __Death Mask 3__ (but don't open it yet).\n    - Fast: You can activate the button from the right side.",
        "Back in the hallway, continue heading into the eastern stairwell, avoiding the zombies and entering into the save room down the stairs.\n    - Note: The first zombie can be safely ran through on the right side and the downstairs zombie can be avoided if you're fast and run around him as wide as possible.",
        "In the save room, pick up the Incendiary Shells and leave.\n    - Safe: Also pickup the FAS and either use it if you need it, or place it in the box if you don't (you're about to run out of inventory space).",
        "Exit the eastern stairwell through the downstairs door (mashing Confirm through its text) and proceed into the gallery across the hall.",

The mask in the box (5th position) (immediately mash Confirm after examining to light first button, then rotate downward to back of box to light the second)\n    3. The first mask in your inventory (4th position)\n    4. Combine the incendiary shells into the grenade launcher (4th and 3rd positions), equip it, then place the final mask (5th position) and move toward the coffin to activate the cutscene",
        "After you regain control of Jill, immediately close the gap between Jill and the elder crimson about halfway before beginning to fire, at which point a number of things can happen:\n    1. He dies in three shots without falling (best RNG)\n    2. He falls down after one or two shots, requiring that you run up to him and aim down to shoot him again and finish him.\n    3. He takes 4 shots (worst RNG) which in a high level run is a reset, but in more casual runs can be mitigated by switching back to the regular grenades to finish him, thus saving 3 incendiary shells for Plant 42.",
        "After elder crimson goes down, un-equip the grenade launcher, retrieve the __Stone and Metal Object__, and leave out through the graveyard and gallery.",
        "After exiting the gallery, avoid the zombie ahead of you and exit through the gate behind him towards the Courtyard.\n    - Fast: Bait the zombie, falling back to the safe strat if sleeping.\n    - Safe: Wait for the zombie to come out of the hallway and run around him.",
        "Run immediately toward the pedestal at the end of this outside hallway, place the Stone and Metal Object, and exit through the door. If you're fast, the dog will not pose a problem."

        "Move to the very back of Lisa's Hut, picking up the __Square Crank__.",
        "Go to the nearby box and deposit the Armor Key and Lighter (first and second items in inventory)\n    - Fast: The item deposting can be optimized by using the ___right___ controller bumper (since left was used on the prior box) before each deposit to more quickly move to empty box positions.",
        "Proceed through the unskippable Lisa cutscene, _but do not hold movement controls at the end_.",
        "At the end of the cutscene, wait roughly half a second before running by Lisa on her right, this will avoid damage every time. Running too soon will almost always cause Lisa to hit you.",
        "Proceed back down the path away from the hut, avoiding the zombie after the stairs.\n    - Fast: If the zombie's back is toward you, run through his backside, else fallback to safe strat.\n    - Safe: You can avoid the zombie completely by running around the right side of the tree next to him.",

        "Shake off the tentacle on the way to Room 002 (spin control stick or dpad and mash confirm and another face button), skipping the cutscenes and entering the bathroom.\n    - Note: It's really not worth trying to push the box around to avoid the tentacle here; it does minimal damage.",
        "Grab the __001 Key__ and leave back out of the room and down the hallway\n    - Fast: If you can grab the key and leave the bathroom fast enough, the zombie will not spawn in Room 002, which saves a tiny bit of time later.",
        "Again shake off the tentacle and go into the bathroom of Room 001. Grab the __Control Room Key__ and leave.",

Push the bookshelves and proceed down the ladder to the Aqua Ring.\n    - Note: If you didn't get the zombie skip, move to the left of him as you pass him to always avoid a grab.\n    - Fast: The left bookshelf can be skipped by beginning movement into it and gradually turning toward the right bookshelf, facing it right as Jill goes into the push animation causing her to catch on the very edge of its hitbox and pushing it instead.",
        "Push those boxes into the water and proceed into the shark room.\n    - Fast: The third box does not need to be pushed all the way against the wall (the final push is usually unnecessary).",
        "Proceed through the shark room, healing with the FAS if necessary.\n    - Fast: Take the middle path. This causes an almost unavoidable shark bite, but it's always the quick bite and is still faster than outside path.\n    - Safe: Take the outside path all the way to door. A shark bite or grab is still possible but less likely.",

Use the lefthand console\n    4. Proceed to the table and check the valve that must be turned (it's RNG; 2 is slower)\n    5. Close the indicated valve\n    6. Again use the righthand console\n    7. Use the lefthand console\n    8. Use the initial console and leave the room",

There is opportunity for really bad RNG here, so it's advised to have either a defense item or healing available for safety in early attempts. Possible bad RNG includes:\n    1. The zombie won't lunge. Fast option is to tank the damage and continue, but if this puts you into Orange Health and you have no healing your run is effectively dead as the closest healing is in the Rec Room. Safe option is to wait for him to walk fully into the room and go around him, but this wastes 6+ seconds.\n    2. The zombie lunges, but then quick recovers and lunges again before you can get around him, grabbing you. The result is the same as the prior RNG.",

Proceed roughly 5 steps up from the turn on the staircase and aim up at P42\n    4. After it has begun to open (sound effect), fire twice, triggering the midway cutscene\n    5. Immediately aim up and quickly fire again, killing it before it closes\n    6. Open your menu, load the grenade shells into the empty launcher and un-equip it",

        "In the waterfall area, plug the Battery into the elevator and take it back up.",
        "Wait on the dog immediately blocking you off the elevator and when it begins running, run the opposite direction that it turns (which is usually to the right). Proceed through to the pool area, avoiding the second dog as best as possible.\n    - Safe: Sometimes it's necessary to use analog to avoid the dogs when they lunge at your wrist. It wastes time but it's faster than taking a grab.\n    - Safe 2: If you have 7 or more grenades, you can equip the grenade launcher to kill the dog at the top of the elevator. It's barely slower than waiting on him to run and much safer.",
        "Use the Square Crank to fill the pool.",
        "Proceed back down to the waterfall area.\n    - Safe: At the first dog down the elevator, wait on the left of it until it begins running, then run to right around it (it should turn left).\n    - Fast: YOLO run (not recommended).",

This is relatively common even in high level runs, but item positions in the rest of this guide will assume this exchange was not made.",

Combine the Red Gem (now 5th position) with the Gem Box (6th position) to begin the puzzle (see next step)\n    3. Once puzzle box is complete, move down into the 7th item position and use the Hex Crank",
        "Gem Box Puzzle: There isn't a consistent strat for this, and it's kind of up to personal preference. Technically, proceeding through the pieces in order is fastest, but some start with the largest piece, placing it in the bottom right. Watch some runs where people do it and practice it however you wish to get it clean when you're ready (not an early priority). Ideally, you're moving pieces on a single axis as much as you can (as opposed to two, e.g. up and right).",
        "Proceed into the next room with the boulder. Get it rolling, run out of the way, skip the cutscene, and proceed to Black Tiger.\n    - Fast: It isn't necessary to run all the way to the boulder before turning around to start the cutscene. Watch runs and play around with it to find your own visual cue.",
        "Before regaining control of Jill, begin holding right on analog to immediately run toward the web door. At this point several different things may happen:\n    1. Best RNG: Black Tiger will screech and lunge towards you. As long as you keep moving to the right of the door this can be avoided 100% of the time, leaving Black Tiger right in front of the door. Move back towards it, equip the grenade launcher and begin shooting it which will also begin removing web from the door. If you're pump canceling, you should be able to kill it before it gets off another attack, which is usually a poison spit. There will be one remaining web on the door. Aim at it and blow it off, then exit.\n    2. Slow Poison: Black Tiger will begin charging a poison (rumbling noise). Quickly equip the grenade launcher and blow off two webs with pump canceling, analog to dodge the poison which should destroy one of the webs, then continue blowing off webs and leave. It shouldn't get another attack in if you're pump canceling.\n    3. Quick Poison: Black Tiger will spit a poison without charging. This can usually be avoided if you continue running past the door, allowing it to hit the door. Equip the grenade launcher and blow off the webs. If you're pump canceling, it shouldn't get off any further attacks.",
        "If you don't need to heal after exiting the Black Tiger room, keep the grenade launcher equipped and proceed to the next room. Otherwise, heal immediately and un-equip it.\n    - Safe: There are blue herbs here if you were poisoned during Black Tiger.",

Push towards the center spinner until it spins\n    7. Push back towards the initial wall 3 times\n    8. Push down until it locks in place and opens the __Cylinder__",

        "If you did not kill Black Tiger, several things can happen when proceeding back through its room. It is best to already be running as you transition in, then adapt according to what Tiger does:\n    1. It _immediately_ begins a screeching long lunge: Turn downward slightly to run behind it.\n    2. It hesitates before screeching to do a close range knockdown: Use analog to dodge away from the camera to avoid it.\n    3. It starts a slow poison: Just keep running through the room.\n    4. It does a quick poison: It's really tough to avoid this. Analog and pray.",
        "Proceed towards and grab the __Cylinder Shaft__. Combine it with the Cylinder (7th and 8th slots), and use it.\n    - Note: You can optionally stop at the box on the way to clear out your inventory of the Grenade Launcher and the two Cranks, which are no longer needed (though if you have grenades left they can be backup in the Lab). This wastes time initially, but saves menu movement for the rest of the run. The rest of the guide will continue to provide item positions in menus assuming you still have these items.",

Consult console version guides for Lisa strats here if you're not playing on 120fps/PC.",
        "Push the box once to the left, and 8 times up, then activate the lift. Exit the room.",
        "Proceed back through Lisa Hall to the elevator room.\n    - Fast: It's possible to just barely squeeze by Lisa here, again taking the inside of the turn, but it is difficult. It requires hugging the wall into the turn relatively closely without dragging against it, then as soon as the camera transition for the turn is about to happen, begin turning into the turn. If done correctly, Jill will briefly get stuck before squeezing through as Lisa begins her swing.\n    - Safe: Bait a swing and wait to proceed. The camera changes suck for analog here, but they can be easily practiced.\n    - Ultra Safe: Go down the stairs first, which will spawn Lisa on the other side of the room, then run back through the side with the wall switch.",
        "Walk towards the elevator to trigger the cutscene, skip, then continue down the ladder at the end of the walkway.",

        "In Lisa hall, flip the switch next to Lisa, then place the Broken Flamethrower (7th slot) and leave.\n    - Fast: It's possible to flip the switch from around the corner by running into the wall and mashing, thus avoiding having to wait on Lisa to swing. She will begin her swing, but if done right, there will be time to run away after the switch flips.\n    - Safe: Run past Lisa the same as your first time through this hallway, flip the switch, and wait for her swing to finish before running back by her.\n    - Ultra Safe: Run along the outside wall in the cave towards Lisa, then hard turn toward the switch when you're parallel with it. This will avoid damage 100% of the time if done correctly.",

        "Proceed down the stairs to the lowest door requiring the Stone and Metal Objects.\n    - Fast: This can be optimized slightly by holding Confirm as you approach the door, triggering viewing it at the most distant point. The initial observation of the door would have to happen later regardless.",

Immediately move towards __Barry's Magnum__ and pick it up\n    3. Move up and slightly to the left until touching the coffin and wait\n    4. As soon as Lisa begins moving, begin pushing the bottom left stone off the edge\n    5. Run around behind Lisa, equip the magnum, and shoot her off the edge (should be: 1 shot to get her to ledge grab, 2 shots to get her to fall)\n    6. Un-equip the magnum and push off the remaining stones, then exit up the elevator in the back (can first-frame activate)\n    7. Note: Shooting Lisa off the edge is sometimes tricky, as her movement is still RNG even with this setup, and it's possible to fire too quick or too far away from her after she ledge grabs, negating the shots. It's best to move closer to her after she ledge grabs and not fire until she has finished her grabbing animation. You should have 3 magnum shots remaining for the Lab. Less will require backup strats. If you have zero shots remaining, you can kill Tyrant with the 6 incendiary shells found in the refueling room, but this is obviously very slow.",

This is risky and not recommended, but it is the only option if you left the Lisa fight with only 2 magnum rounds (unless you have grenades left).\n    - Safe: There are a couple of strats for killing the chimera. One is to shoot with the magnum before triggering the camera transition that shows him (risky as he could jump or crouch while offscreen, wasting a bullet). Second is to run around him, hopefully triggering a swing rather than a crouch or a jump, then shoot him from behind (safer but if he does jump or crouch you must adapt).",

Step count is preserved across rooms. Step sound effects can be used as cues, but hearing 2 step sounds does not necessarily mean two full steps were counted. For instance, if a step sound played as you began walking, you must wait until the third step sound is about to play before running. Being attacked or firing a weapon will (always?) trigger the explosion.\n    - Fast: Avoid the naked stairs zombie in the same manner as before if it was left alive.",
